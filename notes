- Scaffolding:
  - bower.json skeleton file with dependencies.
    bower install to get phaser, any other deps.
  - serve file to compile all coffeescript from coffee/ to build/main.js
  - skeleton index.html to load deps, plus main.js
    Not generating includes or using requirejs at this point.  Too heavyweight.


- Images:
  - ImageMagick convert.
