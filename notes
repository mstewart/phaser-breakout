- Scaffolding:
  - bower.json skeleton file with dependencies.
    bower install to get phaser, any other deps.
  - serve file to compile all coffeescript from coffee/ to build/main.js
  - skeleton index.html to load deps, plus main.js
    Not generating includes or using requirejs at this point.  Too heavyweight.



- Phaser Arcade physics:
  - Basic collision, bouncing is available without having to write special bounce handlers.
    Just register them all as arcade physics bodies, and call Arcade.collide() with the objects/groups
    on every update iteration (even with blank onCollision callback).
  - The onCollision callback is an optional *post-processing* which runs after a collision.
    Importantly, this is after all the physics bouncing has been applied.
    So you can override anything that happened there.


- Images:
  - ImageMagick convert.
    E.g. to convert gif -> png, and resize:
    $ convert block.gif -resize 20% block.png

    Or with explicit pixel size:
    $ convert block.gif -resize 30x30 block.png
